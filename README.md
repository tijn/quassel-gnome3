# quassel-gnome3

Gnome Theme for [Quassel](http://quassel-irc.org/)

Quassel wasn't fitting in. It looked really QT-ish on a Gnome desktop. Therefore I made this stylesheet. I tweaked it, by trial and error, until it was at this point where it looked acceptible to me. I hope it can be useful to someone else too.
